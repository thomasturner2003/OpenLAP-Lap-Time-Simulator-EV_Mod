Overall Goal:
Create an endurance capable simulator

Electro-thermal profiling
	- Record power demands throughout the lap
	- Export power profile in .mat format

Electro-Thermal modelling
	- model battery SOC change through the power profile
	- model battery temperature change through the power profile
	- model motor temperature change through the power profile
	- model inverter temperature change through the power profile

Multi-Lap modelling
	- update electro-thermal states from lap to lap
	- automatically derate based on thermal limits through excel policy
