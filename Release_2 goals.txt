Overall Goal:
Model key powertrain components over multi-lap performance from power profile, rpm and speed.

Battery Modelling
    - SOC change with power discharge
    - Output voltage change with SOC
    - Temperature change from current flow (via power, resistance and output voltage)
    - Internal resistance change with temperature change

Motor Modelling
    - Torque profile generation from battery output voltage
    - Efficiency from voltage and rpm
    - Thermal modelling using power use and efficiency

Inverter Modelling
    - Efficiency based on power requirme

Cooling Modelling
    - NTU based cooling on all core components

Multi-Lap modelling
	- update electro-thermal states from lap to lap
	- automatically derate based on thermal limits
    - excel derating policy option

Key assumption
    - The drivetrain can always produce the rpm required

Key changes
Creation of OpenThermal that creates the thermal and SOC data for a given lap
Creation of OpenMultiLap that calls OpenLap and OpenThermal in successive responses
